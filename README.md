# Neural-Networks

#Project Overview The objective of this project is to build a classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the letters of the alphabet. The dataset consists of features that represent each letter, and the model uses these features to classify the letters. Hyperparameter tuning is done using Keras Tuner to optimize the ANN for better performance.

#Key tasks involved in this project include:

Data loading and exploration Data preprocessing and normalization Building and training an ANN model Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner Model evaluation with classification metrics

#Data Description The dataset used in this project, Alphabets_data.csv, contains features related to the representation of each letter. The dataset includes the following columns:

#letter: The target label representing the alphabet letter. Other columns represent various features that help in predicting the alphabet.

#Data Overview:

Number of Instances: The number of rows in the dataset. Missing Values: Checked for missing data. Descriptive Statistics: Basic summary statistics of the dataset.

#Installation To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

tensorflow keras scikeras pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn keras-tuner You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow scikeras keras-tuner pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
